The tumor is diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and depending on it, tumors are distinguished into different grades of severity. A collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in the brain is called a brain tumor. A rigid skull encloses the brain, and if anything grows in your brain that restricts space, it can cause problems. There are two types of brain tumors: cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). We proposed a new method to detect and extract tumors from whole images. This new method extracts tumors from MRI based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), fuzzy clustering (Fuzzy C-means), and morphological operations. In this paper, a dynamic genetic algorithm is used to optimize the FCM algorithm, and a dynamic genetic algorithm based on segmentation is used in this study. This is due to the following reasons:

    Identify the location of the tumor more easily.
    Determine the ease and precise size of the tumor.

The results of this method show the high accuracy of this method compared to previous methods, and we calculated the precision in clustering that was improved. The other factor that we calculated was overall errors that improved and had the minimum value compared to other methods.![t4_3](https://github.com/artmisamitis1/brain-tumor-detection/assets/85899385/e84410e1-968e-4cc6-afbc-d53c4a2dad94)
